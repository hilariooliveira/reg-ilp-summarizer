The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows.
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year.
