The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
The price of British beef is dropping in the wake of the "mad cow" scare.
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year.
