As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
Next week European Community health ministers will meet to discuss a German call for a ban on British beef imports to that country.
The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
