THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted.
The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.
Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.
