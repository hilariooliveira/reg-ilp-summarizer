THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted.
The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows.
Next week European Community health ministers will meet to discuss a German call for a ban on British beef imports to that country.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
