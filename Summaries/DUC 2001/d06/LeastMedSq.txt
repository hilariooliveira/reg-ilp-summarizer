The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved.
That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by the riots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates's reputation.
The incident renewed calls for a citizen board to review the Police Department.
He said the officers were "set up" by black activists intent on creating a scene with police.
Allegations of police misconduct currently are reviewed by a panel appointed by the mayor.
And the chief said he will stay to implement them.
