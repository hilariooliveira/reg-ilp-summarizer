Over the past two years, the Ventura County district attorney's office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by Oxnard officers, records show.
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop.
The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved.
The district attorney's office may have declined to prosecute the suspects because police brutality has been alleged, she said.
