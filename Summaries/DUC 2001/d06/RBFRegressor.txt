LOS ANGELES -- A much-awaited report that paints a distressing picture of brutality and racism in the Los Angeles Police Department, and that calls for the resignation of its chief, could prompt changes in law enforcement nationwide.
The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved.
Similarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs.
A bystander's videotape of the beating prompted a federal investigation of police brutality.
He said the officers were "set up" by black activists intent on creating a scene with police.
