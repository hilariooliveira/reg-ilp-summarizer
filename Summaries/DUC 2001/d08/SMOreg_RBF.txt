The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to central Brazil .
In the Bay Area, the moon will cover about 55 percent of the sun's surface.
It will be the last chance to see a total solar eclipse this century.
Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the Earth and the sun.
DON'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT;  If you want to watch the moon's progress across the sun: Don't look at it.
There was even an eclipse haircut and, of course, an eclipse drink at the Eclipse restaurant in Kailua-Kona.
