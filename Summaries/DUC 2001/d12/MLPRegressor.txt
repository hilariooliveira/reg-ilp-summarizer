THE US administration has given the go-ahead for pilot plans to reform welfare benefits in Wisconsin and Georgia that could serve as experiments for the broader overhaul of the welfare system promised by President Bill Clinton.
In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
It would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs.
In short, the Family Welfare Reform Act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo.
Substantial numbers of welfare recipients have moved into jobs and off the public rolls.
