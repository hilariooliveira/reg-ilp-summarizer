NEW YORK -- The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in the city rose 38% in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to the health commissioner.
AIDS leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious illnesses, including TB, and studies have found that about 4 percent of AIDS patients also are listed as TB patients.
People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick.
The CDC estimates that 10 million Americans are infected with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, an infection of the lungs.
About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths.
