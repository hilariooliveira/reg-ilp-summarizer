In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count.
The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count.
Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of illegal aliens at 2 million.
At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population.
said that Georgia and Indiana both lost House seats after the 1980 Census, and California and New York -- centers of illegal immigration -- each gained seats.
