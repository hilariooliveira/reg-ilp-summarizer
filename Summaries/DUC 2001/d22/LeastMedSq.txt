Illegal fireworks were blamed for a blaze that swept over 2,200 rugged acres of Stanislaus National Forest in California, 10 miles west of Yosemite National Park.
The fire was the largest in the forest this year.
However, it did not consider policies in other areas such as ordinary national forests, where the Forest Service tries to protect commercial timbering operations.
The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened.
The governor said 5,000 firefighters were battling blazes on 208,000 acres in Montana, and 173,000 acres burned in earlier fires.
