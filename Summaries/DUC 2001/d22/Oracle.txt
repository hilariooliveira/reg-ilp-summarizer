Firefighters in California, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming and Utah battled holiday weekend fires which blackened more than 6,000 acres of forest and wilderness areas.
Authorities estimated that fighting the fire near Lake Elsinore will wind up costing $1.5 million.
The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened.
The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson.
Rain Monday night also calmed three fires in Yellowstone National Park in the state's northwest corner.
