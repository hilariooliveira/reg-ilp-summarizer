Actress Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said.
Elizabeth Taylor will remain in the hospital six more weeks due to complications in her fifth week of treatment for pneumonia, doctors said.
The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors said.
Taylor's doctors expect to have results of the biopsy by Thursday, she said.
Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
