Actress Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said.
Earlier this week, Ms. Sam said the 58-year-old actress was improving and would be released from the hospital this week to recuperate at home.
The actress had issued a statement earlier denying she has AIDS.
Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.
In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and painkillers.
Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic.
