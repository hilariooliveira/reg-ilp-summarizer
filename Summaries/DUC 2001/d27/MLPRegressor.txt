Their beliefs are rooted in an almost theological - some would say fanatical - interpretation of the second amendment to the US constitution, which states that: 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'
Such beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine guns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets.
