Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz.
Zanti became interested in marathon running in April when he watched his 53-year-old father run his first marathon in California.
Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no American has won the women's division.
The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners.
In Rotterdam on Sunday, Belayneh Dinsamo won in 2:08:39.
Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5 minutes.
He dropped out three-quarters of the way through the race.
