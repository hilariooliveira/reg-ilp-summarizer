Zanti became interested in marathon running in April when he watched his 53-year-old father run his first marathon in California.
It was the first time she had finished the race without winning.
The women's field is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash.
Panfil was timed in 2 hours 30 minutes 45 seconds, Jones in 2:30:50.
The men's race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners.
Panfil won the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personal best, and won the New York City Marathon in 1990.
Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5 minutes.
