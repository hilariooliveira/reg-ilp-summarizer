MR Lewis Preston, World Bank president, yesterday promised to strengthen the bank's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries.
It is critical of the U.S. view that strong economic performance in developed countries would trickle down to help the Third World.
But he said the bank had a 'long, long way to go'.
This highlights the diversity of performance on poverty reduction in the third world.
Some Third World banks, notably in Asia, have been making microloans for years.
There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development.
But he doesn't have his own identity as president of the World Bank.
