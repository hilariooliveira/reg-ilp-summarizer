It was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson.
Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds.
Canada's sole gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who finished second in the 100-meter dash.
It has been two years since Johnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics.
To some in track and field that represents a contradiction in terms.
