Here is a chronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, its cleanup and related developments:  March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh Reef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
The tanker that caused the nation's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday.
The calm waters of Prince William Sound have stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in U.S. history, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid chunks of ice, officials said.
