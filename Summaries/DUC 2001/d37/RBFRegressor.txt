Hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging to the M-19 rebel group laid down their arms last month and formed a political party with Pizarro as its presidential candidate.
But the Medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has yet said who was responsible for Pizarro's assassination.
For the first time, leading politicians suggested the government itself might be compromised by the killing.
Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be reorganized.
Official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads.
