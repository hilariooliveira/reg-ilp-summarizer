Less than a month before elections, the assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia to the brink of political chaos.
Reports say that some officials in the Lebanese security organs have links with the Abu-Nidal group.
He said the perpetrators possibly belonged to the Palestinian extremist faction led by Abu Nidal.
They included relatives of the dead, government officials and foreign diplomats.
For the first time, leading politicians suggested the government itself might be compromised by the killing.
Official investigations have shown that certain members of the armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's right-wing death squads.
