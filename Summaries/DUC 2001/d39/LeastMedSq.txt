LONDON -- A shadow is falling across the light at the British end of the Channel Tunnel.
A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon's time that is coming true at last.
The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.
The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry.
Tunneling is three months ahead of schedule on the French side, a week behind on the British.
