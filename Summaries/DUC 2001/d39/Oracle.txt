The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.
Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993.
The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry.
Tunneling is three months ahead of schedule on the French side, a week behind on the British.
Since construction began in late 1987, there have been seven deaths on the British side and two on the French.
