The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West, including one-third of Yellowstone National Park.
But this year is different because the center's strategists and quartermasters who direct the nation's wildfire battles can see some of the worst blazes from their windows.
Further information can be obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's fire prevention unit in Morgan Hill, (408) 779-2121.
They say the park did too little, too late and let the fires get out of hand.
