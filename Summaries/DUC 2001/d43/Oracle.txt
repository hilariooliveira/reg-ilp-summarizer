The South African concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say.
It is also the country's biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export earnings.
Only about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say.
De Beers, which itself mines about 40 per cent of the world's annual rough diamond output, markets stones from Angola, Australia, Namibia, Tanzania, Zaire and the Soviet Union, as well as South Africa and Botswana.
