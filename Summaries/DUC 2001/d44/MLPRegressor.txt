THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
THE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get his free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in international trade arenas.
The president needs 218 votes in the House to ratify Nafta.
The administration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement.
Stock markets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for Nafta improved this week.
