Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.
Tapia emphasized that the Shining Path faction led by Abimael Guzman Reinoso enjoys government favor, and among other things has been given assistance in organizing a second party congress.
Palacios said police had suspected Morote was in the house.
The third point discussed during the Central Committee meeting headed by "Feliciano" referred to the militants who uphold the peace accord.
Government politicians and high-ranking members of the forces of order are also among the main targets.
