Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.
The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region.
A death squad opposed to the Shining Path guerrillas has threatened to kill a district attorney if he investigates charges that soldiers massacred dozens of peasants, his office said Tuesday.
Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.
