Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.
The idea of limiting terms is overwhelmingly popular with Americans regardless of party, ideology or income.
Advocates of the democratic electoral process ought to have similar confidence in the public.
In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.
Changes in the seniority system may therefore be a superior alternative to term limits.
Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock also leans in favor of term limits.
Democracy requires that, and yet we do not have it.
