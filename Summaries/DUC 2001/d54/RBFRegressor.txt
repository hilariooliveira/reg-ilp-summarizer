Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.
Term limits do not add another "qualification" for service in Congress.
Term limitations won't improve the functioning of the legislature, either.
Advocates of the democratic electoral process ought to have similar confidence in the public.
Rather, they prevent citizens from voting for a particular candidate after he has served in office a set number of years.
A powerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which would have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks of term limits.
