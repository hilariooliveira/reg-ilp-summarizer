Also, the high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity, which seems to trigger diabetes, McNamara said.
Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-American.
More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another 150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American Diabetes Association.
Type II, the most common form, develops mostly in obese adults over 40 who also may have a family history of the disease.
Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease.
