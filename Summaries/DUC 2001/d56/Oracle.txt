Health experts believe the Hispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors.
Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-American.
More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another 150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American Diabetes Association.
In Type II diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, the body's insulin is not effective and blood sugar levels rise too high.
Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease, and to a screening test.
