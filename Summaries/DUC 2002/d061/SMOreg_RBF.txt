Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas.
The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico.
It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time," said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph.
Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and Haiti.
