Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake.
The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
The organization estimated residential damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured.
But industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims.
State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.
