Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
Some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more from the quake.
But industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims.
The scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge.
