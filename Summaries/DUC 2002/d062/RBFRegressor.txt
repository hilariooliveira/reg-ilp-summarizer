Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
But industry observers said they don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quake-related claims.
