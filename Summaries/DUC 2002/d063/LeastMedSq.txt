Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are ``monsters'' who will be found and punished.
Family members on Saturday grieved for their slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the Royal Marines Music School, where an IRA terrorist attack killed 10 military musicians.
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
