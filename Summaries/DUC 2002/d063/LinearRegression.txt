More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal.
The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks.
British military installations are a frequent target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988.
The IRA did not specify how it caused the blast.
