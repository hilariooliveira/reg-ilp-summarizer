The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks.
British military installations are a frequent target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in.
It was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982.
