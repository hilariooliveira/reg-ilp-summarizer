An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to collapse and killing eight people, officials said.
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA's campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks.
