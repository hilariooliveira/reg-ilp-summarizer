Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches.
The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.
The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.
For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger.
