SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.
By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company.
But no one has ever been able to make Sam himself look bad.
Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in October 1985.
Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's wealthiest people.
