SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
He's ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.
His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.
By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company.
