SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.
Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.
By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company.
