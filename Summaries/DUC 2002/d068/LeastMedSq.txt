Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing by the Berlin Wall, was to be hauled away Friday.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoint's removal Friday.
The envoys from the German states and the four World War II Allies that divided them were in East Berlin to discuss the international aspects of German unification.
Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily, and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.
