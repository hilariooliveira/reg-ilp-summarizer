The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000 troops in West Berlin.
Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily, and U.S. officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting.
Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from an East German checkpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.
The checkpoint went up with the Berlin Wall in 1961.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their counterparts from France, Britain and the two Germanys presided over the ceremony.
