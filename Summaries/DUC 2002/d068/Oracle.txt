Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War, was hoisted into history today.
The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany.
Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain, France and the two German states.
Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was lifted into the sky by a giant crane Friday, placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history.
