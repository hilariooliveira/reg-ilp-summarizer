East Germany's ousted secret police chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper reported Wednesday.
The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after being released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
Honecker joins other members of his ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.
Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and state funds.
