East Germany authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison today, and a prosecutor said he will tried for high treason in March.
Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said.
82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke shouted at Honecker, according to Bild newspaper.
Eleven members of Honecker's ousted Politburo already are in prison awaiting trial.
