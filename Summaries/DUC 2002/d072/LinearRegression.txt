Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra.
The concert will celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in popular music with excerpts from ``West Side Story,'' ``On the Town'' and others.
The concert also included Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein works.
During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer home, Tanglewood.
