Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra.
Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden and Phyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash being thrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the music center where he got his start.
He last conducted Aug. 19 at the Tanglewood Music Center in western Massachusetts.
The concert will celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in popular music with excerpts from ``West Side Story,'' ``On the Town'' and others.
