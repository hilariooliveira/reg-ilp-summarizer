Three major new eruptions rocked Mount Pinatubo late Wednesday night and early today, forcing another emergency evacuation of Clark Air Base and increasing fears of even more violent explosions from the long-dormant volcano in the days ahead.
The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy.
He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from Clark .
Friday, eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly 19 miles high.
The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said the explosions occurred at 10:52 p.m. and 11:05 p.m.
