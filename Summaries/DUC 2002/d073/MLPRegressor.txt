The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters.
Mount Pinatubo erupted with six thundering explosions today, shooting a giant plume of ash 15 miles high.
The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.
He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from Clark .
The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy.
