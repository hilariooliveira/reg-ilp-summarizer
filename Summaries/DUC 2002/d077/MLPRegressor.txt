A major earthquake rocked northern California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95 miles away.
It was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.
A 5.9 aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area.
The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault.
Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale.
