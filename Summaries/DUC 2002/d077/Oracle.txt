A major earthquake rocked northern California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95 miles away.
By contrast the streets in most of San Francisco were passable within a day of the earthquake.
Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale.
The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault.
It was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.
