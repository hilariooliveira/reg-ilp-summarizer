The motion picture industry's most coveted award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes have been produced so far.
The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best picture or best director.
The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy's conscience.
Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win an Academy Award.
