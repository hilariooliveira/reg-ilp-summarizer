Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains.
The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the Dominican Republic, civil defense officials said.
It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph.
At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude 25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National Hurricane Center in Florida.
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
