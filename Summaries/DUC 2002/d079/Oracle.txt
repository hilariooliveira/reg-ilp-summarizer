The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
Gilbert surged into the gulf after battering the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousands to flee.
The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26 people dead in Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic, 10 in Haiti and the six in Mexico.
By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by this morning.
Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
