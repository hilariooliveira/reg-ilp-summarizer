The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.
The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts.
And some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody.
The district attorney who originally pursued the case said he would not have done anything differently.
In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of the children were molested, but the prosecution never established that the defendants were responsible.
Five women teachers who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them dismissed.
