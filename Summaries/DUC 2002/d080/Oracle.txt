The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.
In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges.
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case.
And some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody.
The jury deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations.
PEGGY MCMARTIN BUCKEY, 63 -- Co-defendant in the McMartin case, she both directed the Virginia McMartin Pre-School and taught there.
