The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.
The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts.
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case.
And some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody.
Although they acquitted defendants of most charges, the jurors deadlocked on 13 counts.
PEGGY MCMARTIN BUCKEY, 63 -- Co-defendant in the McMartin case, she both directed the Virginia McMartin Pre-School and taught there.
