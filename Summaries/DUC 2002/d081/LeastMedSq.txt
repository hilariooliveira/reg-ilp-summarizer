The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.
Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners are still working, but output in some key regions has been halved, saddling Gorbachev with a substantial labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the Soviet economy The strike is the new union's first major test of strength.
They are unhappy with Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty, which would leave the central government in control of the economy, defense, foreign policy and communications, he said Second, the union is demanding more power for Gorbachev's Federation Council, which includes the presidents of all the republics Finally, the union wants a "law on property" that would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of land and industry, including some mines, he said According to the state news agency Tass, the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of the Ukraine, the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia, and the Kuznetsk coal basin of western Siberia.
