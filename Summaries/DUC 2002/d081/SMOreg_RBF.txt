More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in the southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demand legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest threatens his economic reforms.
The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of improved living and job conditions.
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
On Saturday, miners in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.
