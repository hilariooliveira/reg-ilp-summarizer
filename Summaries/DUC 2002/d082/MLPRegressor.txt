Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union.
The human rights activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
