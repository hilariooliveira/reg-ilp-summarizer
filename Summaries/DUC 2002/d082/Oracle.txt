Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner has praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social and economic reform.
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into Afghanistan.
Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him he could return to Moscow.
