Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The human rights activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile.
Those writings have not been published in the Soviet Union.
