Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst disaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast that ripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.
Meanwhile, Navy investigators on board studied an amateur videotape for clues into Wednesday's explosion in the ship's No. 2 gun turret.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice.
