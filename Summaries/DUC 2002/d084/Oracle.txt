Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are outmoded and dangerous.
The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion.
A seven-member team of investigators boarded the battleship a day after the explosion flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret on Wednesday.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
