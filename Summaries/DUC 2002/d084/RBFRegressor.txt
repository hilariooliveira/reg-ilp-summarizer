The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
The center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.
The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.
