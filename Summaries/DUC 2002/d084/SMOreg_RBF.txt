The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before the explosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
Ships with those guns _ the battleships Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin _ were built during World War II.
The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.
