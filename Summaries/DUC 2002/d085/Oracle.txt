Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings.
That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today.
By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston.
