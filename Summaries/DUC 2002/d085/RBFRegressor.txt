Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the severity of damage" as in Hugo, Parsons said.
Before the hurricane warning system was established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of lives.
North and South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two days, according to the hurricane center.
