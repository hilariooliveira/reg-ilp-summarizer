Dave Johnson of the United States clinched the decathlon gold medal in the final event at the World University Games Sunday.
She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win four track and field gold medals in a single Olympics.
In her 200 quarterfinal heat Wednesday, Griffith Joyner ran an Olympic record 21.76 seconds.
Johnson leads the world decathlon rankings this year with 8,549 points.
Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold in 1948 and '52.
Sheldon Blockburger of the U.S. was third going into the last event.
