President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday.
President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last appeal'' from his wife.
Marcos' wife Imelda appealed today to Mrs. Aquino to ``open her heart'' and allow the former president to return.
Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
Philippine officials were asked repeatedly whether the Aquino government's refusal to allow Marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death.
