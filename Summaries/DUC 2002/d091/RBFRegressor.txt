The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
The 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at the Ohio River, about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.
The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
I don't think there's anybody alive out there,'' he said.
The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during storms that poured 5{ inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3{ hours.
