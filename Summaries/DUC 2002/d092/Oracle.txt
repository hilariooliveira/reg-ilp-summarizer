An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake.
Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured in the earthquake that struck Thursday.
Shokooh said the effort to help the earthquake victims was put together hastily Friday afternoon.
