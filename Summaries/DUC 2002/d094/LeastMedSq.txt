To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used.
World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some declared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday, but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us.
The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their reigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor Meiji, Hirohito's grandfather.
Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness, and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.
