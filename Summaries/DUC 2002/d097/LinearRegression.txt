Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C. Losses Still Being Tallied Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.
