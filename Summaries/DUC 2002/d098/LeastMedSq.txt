Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to release its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space telescope.
