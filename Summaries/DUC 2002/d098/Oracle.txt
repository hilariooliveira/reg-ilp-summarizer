Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
The $1.5 billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical problems and the Challenger explosion.
Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space telescope.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
