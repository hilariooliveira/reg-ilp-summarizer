The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space telescope.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
