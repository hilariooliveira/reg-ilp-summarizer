A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.
An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15 issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.
Acceptance is a difficult concept for her "I'm used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it," Ono says during a telephone interview She's speaking from the New York office of Bag One Arts, the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image Marketing an icon; Since his death in 1980, Ono has steadily kept Lennon products coming out: the albums "Milk and Honey" and "Menlove Avenue" and the 4-CD boxed set "The John Lennon Collection"; the book "Skywriting by Word of Mouth," a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings; Lennon's art, which Ono says was his main interest in his final years; and Lennon-inspired merchandise, such as a line of John Lennon eyeglasses "I told the fans that I'm going to do 10 years of it.
"I just like to create," she says Ono still lives in the Dakota apartment house in New York, the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan On Dec. 8, 1980, the couple was returning home from the recording studio where they had been remixing "Walking on Thin Ice," one of the songs that would appear on Ono's most successful album, "Season of Glass."
