The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem ``Imagine'' was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 nations.
Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session on Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only hours before.
Not so long ago, the Beatles' music was banned in the Soviet Union.
