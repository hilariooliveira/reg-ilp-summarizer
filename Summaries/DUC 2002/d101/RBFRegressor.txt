Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was said to be back in power today and returning to Moscow as the coup against him collapsed and its leaders reportedly fled.
Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover.
Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and his acting defense minister, and named a new head of the KGB.
In the United States, President Bush said he spoke to Gorbachev and the Soviet leader was "calling the shots" again.
No one really came to Gorbachev's assistance as leader of the country," one U.S. official said.
