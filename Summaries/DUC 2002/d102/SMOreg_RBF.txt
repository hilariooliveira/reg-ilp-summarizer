The actor who played Little Ricky on the ``I Love Lucy'' show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille Ball than he did with his own family in the five years he played the comedian's TV son.
It's called ``Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball.''
``But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on.''
Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball starred, ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy,'' aired Monday nights.
