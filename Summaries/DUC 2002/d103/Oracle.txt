The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
The location is followed by the Richter scale magnitude and the number of dead.
Iran, which has had no diplomatic ties with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale.
