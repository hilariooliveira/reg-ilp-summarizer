Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.
Countries worldwide, both friendly and hostile to Tehran's Islamic government, sent supplies, medical personnel and condolences to Iran, where about 40,000 people have died in an earthquake.
The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
The earthquake that devastated Iran early Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
