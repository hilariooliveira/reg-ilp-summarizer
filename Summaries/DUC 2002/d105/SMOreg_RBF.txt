Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances.
Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on ``equal use'' of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions.
