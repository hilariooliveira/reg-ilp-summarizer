From behind bars, Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in South Africa.
A representative of the African National Congress said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday.
They denied South African police and press reports that the child was Mandela's great-granddaughter.
Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government.
April-June, 1964 Mandela and seven others are sentenced to life in prison.
May, 1984 Mandela is allowed a visit with his wife -- the first since 1962.
