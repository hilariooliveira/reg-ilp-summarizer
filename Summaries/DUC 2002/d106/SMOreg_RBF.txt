From behind bars, Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in South Africa.
A representative of the African National Congress said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday.
Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government.
ANC officials said the dead child was the great niece of Mandela's father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela.
Mandela was released in February after 27 years in jail for opposing the white minority government.
