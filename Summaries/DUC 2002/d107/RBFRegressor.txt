Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here.
Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend.
The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday.
