While inspecting flood control and relief work in Qingyuan city on the Beijiang River yesterday, he attributed Guangdong's success in combating this flood -- almost the biggest in 100 years -- to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in Guangdong and local residents.
The water level of the river, which flows through Changsha, is still rising sharply, according to local sources.
Information from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters revealed that the flood peak on the Xijiang River today reached Guangdong Province.
The Jiangxi provincial party committee and people's government are mobilizing local people and the troops stationed there to combat the floods.
