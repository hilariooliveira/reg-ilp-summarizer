Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich ally of Kuwait, has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border.
In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and the Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions.
The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said the 100,000 soldiers who invaded Kuwait began to pull back Sunday .
They were being transported by bus to the Iraqi border.
Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides claim.
