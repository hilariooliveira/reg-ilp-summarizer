An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment.
A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to answer to the Argentine ship's warnings.
The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials said.
