A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to answer to the Argentine ship's warnings.
The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking ship.
On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its ``fisheries'' patrol about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple.
