A Florida couple said their pleasure boat was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard reported Sunday.
A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known.
He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet in length.
Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
