LONDON -- Following his takeover of the unprofitable New York Daily News, British publisher Robert Maxwell plans to raise around #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of shares in his Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. of Britain.
Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts.
