LONDON -- Following his takeover of the unprofitable New York Daily News, British publisher Robert Maxwell plans to raise around #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of shares in his Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. of Britain.
Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 421.5m in the year to December 29 1991, including Pounds 208.6m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 122.4m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies.
Maxwell Communication said last month that its management would be taken over by Kevin Maxwell, Ian's brother.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
