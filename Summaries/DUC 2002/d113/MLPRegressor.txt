MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured.
The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
