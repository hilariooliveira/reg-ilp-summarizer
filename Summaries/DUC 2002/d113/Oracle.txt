The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.
Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
