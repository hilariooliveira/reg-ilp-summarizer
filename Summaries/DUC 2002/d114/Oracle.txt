Hindu-dominated India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri militants fighting for secession of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state with a Moslem majority.
Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people.
At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by Moslem separatists.
Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned on gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
They have fought wars over Kashmir and the border question remains unresolved.
