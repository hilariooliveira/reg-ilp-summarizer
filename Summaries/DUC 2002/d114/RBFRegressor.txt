Moslem militants killed five people who opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday.
The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem.
At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by Moslem separatists.
Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's states with a Moslem majority.
The 12 surviving militants were arrested, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The two countries have twice gone to war over the territory.
