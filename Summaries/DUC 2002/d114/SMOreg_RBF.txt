Moslem militants killed five people who opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday.
A bystander was injured, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem.
India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir, in 1948 and 1965.
At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by Moslem separatists.
Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's states with a Moslem majority.
