A strong earthquake hit the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal and parts of eastern India on Sunday morning, triggering landslides and collapsing buildings.
Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible since Sunday's devastating quake.
The quake injured at least 2,000 people in India and 1,000 in Nepal, officials said.
In New Delhi, the Seismologoical Observatory said the quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since 1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the eastern Indian state of Assam.
