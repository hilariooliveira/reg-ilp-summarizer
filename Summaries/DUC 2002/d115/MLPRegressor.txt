An earthquake that devastated parts of Nepal and India earlier this week has killed more than 980 people, officials from the two countries said Friday.
Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible since Sunday's devastating quake.
The quake injured at least 2,000 people in India and 1,000 in Nepal, officials said.
It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since 1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the eastern Indian state of Assam.
Observatory Director H.N. Srivastava said the quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
