The death toll from the Himalayan earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of Nepal and found more bodies.
Sunday's pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and claimed at least 497 lives in Nepal and 200 in India, government officials said.
News reports said 400 people died in Bihar state, double the Indian government's count.
The government hospital in Dharan treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood houses collapsed.
Official accounts said more than 1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed 30,000 were killed.
