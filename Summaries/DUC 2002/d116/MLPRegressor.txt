Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved.
Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
