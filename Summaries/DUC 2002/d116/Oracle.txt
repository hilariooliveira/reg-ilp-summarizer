Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
The first time was in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded.
Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space.
In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.
