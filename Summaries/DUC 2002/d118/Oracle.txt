The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits, including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors.
In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary of defense,'' the statement said.
The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination.
Most Democrats, in the end, went with Sen. Nunn.
