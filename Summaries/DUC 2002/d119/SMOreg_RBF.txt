President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
They also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts.
The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988.
Meanwhile, Bush's choice as assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said.
