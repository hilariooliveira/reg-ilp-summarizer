John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century.
Major received 185 votes, two short of a majority.
Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people.
Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year.
