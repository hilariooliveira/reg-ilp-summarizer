We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century.
Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine received 131 and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56.
Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party.
He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues.
TORY ELECTION RESULTS Despite being two votes short of a majority, John Major was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers conceded defeat.
