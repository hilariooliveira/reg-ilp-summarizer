John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we're going to win the next general election,'' said Major, who will be the youngest British prime minister in this century.
Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year.
Cunningham pointed out that 187 members of Major's own party, a majority in the House of Commons, voted against him Tuesday.
