British police said Saturday they have arrested former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was held Friday night after British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
The Spanish authorities contend that Pinochet may have committed crimes against Spanish citizens in Chile.
Chile has protested the arrest, insisting that, as a senator for life, Pinochet enjoyed diplomatic immunity under his diplomatic passport.
Human rights and international law experts expressed enthusiastic support Saturday for the British arrest, and said it could have wide implications.
