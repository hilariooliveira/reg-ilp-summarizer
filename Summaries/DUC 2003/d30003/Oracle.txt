Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has been arrested by British police on a Spanish extradition warrant, despite protests from Chile that he is entitled to diplomatic immunity.
Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.
The warrant on which he was arrested alleges that Pinochet ``did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within the jurisdiction of the government of Spain,'' and was guilty of ``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.''
The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic passport and had immunity from arrest.
