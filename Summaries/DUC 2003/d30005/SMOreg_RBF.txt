Urged on by the Clinton administration, Saudi Arabia's top intelligence official met privately with the leader of the Taliban in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan to deport Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding the August bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. and Arab officials.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday that one of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and ``asked him for a mission.''
Bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant who lives in Afghanistan, has long been suspected of involvement in that and other attacks on Americans, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S. Embassies in Africa.
