A car bomb exploded Friday in a Jerusalem market crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath.
Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants, injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet to put off action on the new peace accord.
The radical group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, but Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militant Islamic Jihad.
Under the Wye accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the West Bank, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, promised to crack down on Palestinian terrorists.
