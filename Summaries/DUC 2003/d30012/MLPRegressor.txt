known as the Leonids because they seem to come from the direction of the constellation Leo _ have about as much chance of seriously damaging the world's satellites as Mark McGwire does of smashing the windshield of the sole car in an otherwise empty parking lot with a blast from inside a Major League ballpark.
In addition to a physical threat, though, the Leonids, generally smaller than grains of sand, also pose the risk of creating strong electrical charges on satellites, potentially damaging sensitive components.
The companies plan to turn solar arrays so that their edges face the oncoming meteors, presenting a smaller target.
