Investigators looking into the crash last month of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ``heat damage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system, prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo jets, Swissair officials said Thursday.
But such switches did not cause the crash of the MD-11 being flown as Swissair Flight 111 on Sept. 2, aviation authorities said, because the cockpit switches in that plane had already been changed.
Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video-on-demand system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit, after Canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on wiring and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the MD-11.
