Investigators looking into the crash last month of Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ``heat damage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system, prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo jets, Swissair officials said Thursday.
Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the Swissair crash, which involved smoke in the cockpit and killed all 229 people aboard.
But a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which is in charge of the investigation of the Swissair crash, said the Mylar insulation recovered from the plane did not show heat damage.
