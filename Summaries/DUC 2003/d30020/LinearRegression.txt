China's women divers expect to clinch Asian Games gold in the platform competition but could face stiff competition from Kazakstan in the springboard.
The team of six women and three men will be China's first to compete in taekwondo at the Asian Games, the report said.
But she acknowledged that Kazakstan's Irina Vyguzova could challenge China in the women's three-meter springboard, Xinhua said.
The team won three gold medals at this year's world championships.
Two of those went in the medley events to world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, who will lead the Chinese team here.
