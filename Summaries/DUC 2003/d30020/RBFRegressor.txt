China's women divers expect to clinch Asian Games gold in the platform competition but could face stiff competition from Kazakstan in the springboard.
The team of six women and three men will be China's first to compete in taekwondo at the Asian Games, the report said.
With South Korea, Taiwan and Iran _ the strongest taekwondo nations _ all competing in the upcoming games, ``the Chinese team's goal is to go all out to win one gold medal,'' it said.
But the Indians have won an Asian Games gold medal only once, silver eight times and bronze once.
The team won three gold medals at this year's world championships.
