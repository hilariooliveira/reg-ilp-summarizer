Brazilian voters gave President Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of balloting Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
In preliminary returns, Cardoso appeared to have defeated Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party, with 56 percent of the vote, a far stronger showing than polls initially predicted.
With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since Russia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of elections.
