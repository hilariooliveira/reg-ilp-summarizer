Brazilian voters appeared to re-elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of balloting Sunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
With 22 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to have won 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential candidate of the leftist Workers Party.
The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by coming up with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves.
His victory could have complicated Cardoso's efforts to control state spending and win congressional approval for reforms.
