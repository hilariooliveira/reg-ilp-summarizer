Brazilian voters appeared to re-elect President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of balloting Sunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country struggling against economic crisis.
Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo Bovespa, lost 4.5 percent while the smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange fell 3.4 percent.
The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by coming up with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves.
After the election, Cardoso said the package could be announced by Oct. 20.
The president said he would cut government costs, crack down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase revenues.
