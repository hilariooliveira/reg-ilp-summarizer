Israel is not involved in any way in the current, growing confrontations between Turkey and Syria, a spokesman said Saturday.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew here on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.
The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge Damascus denies.
Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in Ankara, possibly on Monday.
