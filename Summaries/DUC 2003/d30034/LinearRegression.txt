Assailants killed three soldiers and a civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's official Antara news agency reported Sunday.
He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese rule.
The killings occurred amid reports that the number of Indonesian troops in East Timor was more than 20,000, far in excess of the number claimed by the Indonesian government.
