More than 100 people held a candlelight vigil outside the Indonesian Embassy Thursday, demanding that President B.J. Habibie put an end to violence in East Timor.
Assailants killed three soldiers and a civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's official Antara news agency reported Sunday.
He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence protesters in Dili, the East Timor capital.
The rebels also took his gun, said Col. Suhartono Suratman, chief of the local military.
