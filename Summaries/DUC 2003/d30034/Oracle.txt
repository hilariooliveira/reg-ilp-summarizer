Assailants killed three soldiers and a civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's official Antara news agency reported Sunday.
He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of Portugal's colonial administration.
Human rights activists claim at least 200 people were killed.
The killings occurred amid reports that the number of Indonesian troops in East Timor was more than 20,000, far in excess of the number claimed by the Indonesian government.
