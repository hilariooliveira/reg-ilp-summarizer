African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban which was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
After that such acts will automatically come to an end,'' Gadhafi said.
The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.
