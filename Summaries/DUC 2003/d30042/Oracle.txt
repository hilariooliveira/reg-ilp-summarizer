In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S._British plan for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to hand over the defendants.
Council members also agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the suspects.
The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.
