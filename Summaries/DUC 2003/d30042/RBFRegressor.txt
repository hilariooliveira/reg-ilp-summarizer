Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived Monday in Egypt after meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban which was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to hand over the defendants.
