Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
Ocalan has been labeled a terrorist by Turkey and the United States.
It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels.
He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankara for Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made the same request.
