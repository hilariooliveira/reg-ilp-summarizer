Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
Abdullah Ocalan was arrested after stepping off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.
Turkey has branded him a terrorist, holding him responsible for nearly 37,000 deaths in the conflict.
