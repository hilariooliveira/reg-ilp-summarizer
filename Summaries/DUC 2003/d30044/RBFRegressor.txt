Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since 1984 in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.
He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankara for Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made the same request.
