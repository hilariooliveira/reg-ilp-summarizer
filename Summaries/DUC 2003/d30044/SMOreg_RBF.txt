Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a terrorist organization.
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Kurdish insurgents who has been sought for years by Turkey, has been detained in Rome after stepping off a plane from Moscow, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.
Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in Italy.
