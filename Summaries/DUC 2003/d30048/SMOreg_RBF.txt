With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since Russia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian government has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach of elections.
While President Clinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion to restock the International Monetary Fund this week, with an eye toward assisting Brazil, the team that returned here from the IMF's annual meeting in Washington earlier this month scoured government accounts for politically feasible sources of savings and reform.
``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil and whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the budget deficit,'' he said.
Putting Brazil's finances in order will be painful, but not as painful as economic collapse.
