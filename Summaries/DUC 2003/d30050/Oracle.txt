The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Carol Moseley-Braun, and state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns in the country.
The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune, suggests that Ms. Moseley-Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantly rising star, is in serious election trouble.
But like most New Yorkers _ or more specifically, like most people who will vote on Nov. 3 _ the three-term Republican senator and his Democratic challenger are closer to the center than to either extreme.
The Republicans could have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate.
