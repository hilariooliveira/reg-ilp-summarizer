On one side is D'Amato, who, as Schumer said again Sunday, voted to cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battled environmentalists.
In years like 1980, for example, when the Republicans took a majority as Ronald Reagan was elected president, or 1986, when the party lost control of the Senate (and lost more seats there than it did in the House), or 1994, when the Democrats lost control of both houses after the failure of Clinton's proposed health care overhaul, ``all the close races went one way,'' Rothenberg said.
The representative has parried each ideological assault by D'Amato by asserting that it is the senator who is the ideological extremist, and then by blurring his own ideological evolution with a recitation of what was his own march on the political center as he prepared in Congress for this race.
