Yugoslav war crimes tribunal investigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe of alleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal official said Wednesday.
In the Netherlands, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal locked horns with the Yugoslav government over the tribunal's jurisdiction in Kosovo.
Holbrooke said Milosevic had agreed to a doubling of war crimes tribunal staff in Belgrade and to letting them travel freely in Kosovo, where the tribunal wants to look into reports of Serb massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians.
She said Belgrade's defiance of the tribunal amounted to ``a challenge to the authority of the Security Council'' which has ordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovo and told Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.
