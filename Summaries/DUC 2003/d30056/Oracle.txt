Chechen authorities found the remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the breakaway region in southern Russia.
The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with their bodyguards.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men had been recovered.
Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from Russia in 1996.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
