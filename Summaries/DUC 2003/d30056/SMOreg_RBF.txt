Chechen authorities found the remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the breakaway region in southern Russia.
The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had been found without giving further details.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men had been recovered.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
Kidnapping of foreigners for ransom is rampant in Chechnya, a lawless region in southern Russia.
