Bestowing on him the ``radiant badge of martyrdom,'' Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions in the Balkans.
Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the Vatican.
But his beatification, the last step before possible sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
