Hailing the World War II archbishop of Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the Communist system,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him Saturday.
But his beatification, the last step before possible sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic, and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
