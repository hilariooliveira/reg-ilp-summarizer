Hailing the World War II archbishop of Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the Communist system,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him Saturday.
The pope's visit was joyously welcomed by Croats and the nationalist government of President Franjo Tudjman.
Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the Nazis.
After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Ante Pavelic led a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly independent Croatia.
It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994 pilgrimage.
The cause of Stepinac is one of the most controversial to date.
