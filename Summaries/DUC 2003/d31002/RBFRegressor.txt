Declaring him a martyr of the faith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War II cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisions in the Balkans.
The pope arrived in Croatia, a country of 4 million that is more than 75 percent Catholic, on Friday to beatify one of Croatia's national heros, Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was persecuted by Tito after World War II and died under house arrest in 1960.
For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit was Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac.
