Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob ties.
Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a governing coalition.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led government.
Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in Parliament.
