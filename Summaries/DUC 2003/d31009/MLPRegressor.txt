Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal, setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in Parliament.
The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led government out of office last year, after it came to power in a coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
