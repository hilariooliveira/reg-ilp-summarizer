Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a governing coalition.
By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go to the Islamic Virtue Party since it is has the most seats in Parliament.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led government.
Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in Parliament.
