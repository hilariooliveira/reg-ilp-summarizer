The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal, setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go to the Islamic Virtue Party since it is has the most seats in Parliament.
