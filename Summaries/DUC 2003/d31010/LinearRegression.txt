An Arctic cold wave that hit Poland a week ago has killed 32 people, police said Monday.
Police said a 40-year-old man was found frozen to death in central Poland on Thursday morning.
Most victims have been the homeless or men who passed out from drinking.
The cold front arrived on Nov. 16 with temperatures dipping as low as minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
Police say the number of cold-related deaths in recent weeks is 29 more than the number for all of last winter.
Many of the victims were homeless, and most had been drinking alcohol, which lowers the body temperature.
