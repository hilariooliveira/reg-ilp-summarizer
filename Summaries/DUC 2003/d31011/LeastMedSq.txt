Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday after killing at least 156 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
Typhoon Babs raced toward southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines this month.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
