Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday after killing at least 156 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
The storm was expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Tuesday, the observatory said.
Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from their homes near flooded rivers.
In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the death toll from Babs has risen to 151.
