Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday after killing more than 150 people in the Philippines and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.
Typhoon Babs raced toward southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
The storm earlier killed at least 156 people in the Philippines and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
At least 69 people from the province died, most of them buried in landslides.
Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines this month.
