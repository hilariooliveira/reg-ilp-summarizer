The obstetrician, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper on Friday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb.
Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks.
Last November, a doctor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was shot in the shoulder by a bullet fired through a window.
Police said Slepian was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
Slepian divided his practice between the clinic in Buffalo and his private office in Amherst.
