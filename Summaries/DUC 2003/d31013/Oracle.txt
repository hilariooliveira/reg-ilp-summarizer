The obstetrician, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper on Friday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb.
Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks.
In 45 states, the number of doctors who performed abortions declined between 1982 and 1992.
Police said Slepian was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
In interviews with The Buffalo News, Slepian said he took the rhetoric of abortion opponents seriously.
