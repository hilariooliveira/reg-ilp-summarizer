The obstetrician, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper on Friday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb.
Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks.
The slaying comes more than six years after anti-abortion protesters descended on Buffalo.
Police said Slepian was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
More affluent women, she says, can go to private doctors who will perform abortions.
