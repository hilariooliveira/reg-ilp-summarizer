A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening. ''
The hall was crowded to far more than its legal capacity of 150; witnesses have estimated the crowd as large as 400 people.
The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight Thursday remains under investigation.
Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
