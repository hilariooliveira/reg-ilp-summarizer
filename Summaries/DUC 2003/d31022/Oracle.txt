A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a news conference.
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
