A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
The earlier information that police gave out was wrong,'' Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight Thursday remains under investigation.
Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
