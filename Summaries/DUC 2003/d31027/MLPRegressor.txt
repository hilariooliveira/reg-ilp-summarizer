Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5 million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
