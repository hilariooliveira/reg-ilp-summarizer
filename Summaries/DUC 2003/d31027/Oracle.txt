Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by political hard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted to run in Friday's election to the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly of Experts and the moderates only 13.
