But Hurricane Georges, which hit the island last month and caused several billion dollars in damages, has brought out one big difference: while nearly every home in the 50 states is insured, insurance executives and government officials estimate that only 30 percent or 40 percent of those here are covered.
The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies.
Many past hurricanes damaged only a few islands.
While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what the federal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the Gulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in Puerto Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
Maybe they should develop products more in line with people's capacity to buy insurance.''
About a dozen companies, mostly Puerto Rican, sell insurance on the island.
