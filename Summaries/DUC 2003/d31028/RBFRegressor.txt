Many past hurricanes damaged only a few islands.
The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies.
While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what the federal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the Gulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in Puerto Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
The reason many people in Puerto Rico do not have insurance on their homes, officials and insurers here say, is mostly a matter of money.
But that's the way a lot of people think.''
