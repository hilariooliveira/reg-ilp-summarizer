With just five days until money for the new fiscal year runs out, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats on Monday escalated their criticism of Republican leaders for not moving faster on the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running.
So far, Congress has completed work on only four of those bills.
Clinton addressed several issues that Congress will be haggling over in the next few days as House and Senate Republicans try to resolve their own differences.
House and Senate leaders said they expected five spending bills to be especially difficult to negotiate and that they would probably be wrapped into one big omnibus package at the end of the week and sent to the White House.
