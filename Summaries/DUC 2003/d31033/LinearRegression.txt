A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayed the company's competitor in the Internet software business, Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participant in deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to divide the market.
Among other charges, the government's suit accuses Microsoft of trying to persuade Netscape executives, at the meeting on June 21, 1995, to quit marketing browsers that run on Windows computers.
In one memo, written in December 1995 _ in the thick of Microsoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market _ Gates wrote a memo to others in the company acknowledging that Netscape was designing browser software ``far better than we are.''
