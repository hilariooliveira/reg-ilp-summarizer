A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayed the company's competitor in the Internet software business, Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participant in deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to divide the market.
Among other charges, the government's suit accuses Microsoft of trying to persuade Netscape executives, at the meeting on June 21, 1995, to quit marketing browsers that run on Windows computers.
According to the government, Microsoft offered to make an investment in Netscape and give Netscape's software developers crucial technical information about the Windows operating system if Netscape would agree not to make a browser for Windows 95 operating system, which Microsoft released two months later.
