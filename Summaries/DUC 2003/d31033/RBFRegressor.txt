A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayed the company's competitor in the Internet software business, Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participant in deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to divide the market.
The memo, from Dan Rosen, a senior Microsoft executive who attended the meeting with Netscape's leaders, was written to Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and others.
The antitrust suit, initiated last October, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its Internet Explorer World Wide Web browser with the industry-dominant Windows 95 operating system.
