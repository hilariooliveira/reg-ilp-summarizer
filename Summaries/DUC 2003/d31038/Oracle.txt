Last month, el Hage was arrested on charges of being part of the Osama bin Laden terror network that is suspected of the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
One carried the bomb, the other guided the first vehicle through the streets of Nairobi to the embassy.
Administration officials say they want him to face trial in the United States.
A twin attack on the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.
Bin Laden already faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealed indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in New York.
