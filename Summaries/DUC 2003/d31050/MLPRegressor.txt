Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, is to go on trial Dec. 17.
On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters of the new party, were detained.
In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something over two hours.
The Communist Party has never allowed another political party to form since it took power in 1949.
The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed to be in custody.
