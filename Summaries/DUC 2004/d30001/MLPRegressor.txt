Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed.
The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election.
The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament.
The two parties said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.
