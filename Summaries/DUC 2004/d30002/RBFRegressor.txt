In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities.
He urged the more than 1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery effort.
Officials in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have died in the region.
