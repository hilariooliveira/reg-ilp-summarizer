At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.
President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had set back Honduras' development by 50 years.
Officials in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have died in the region.
That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane conditions for more than a day.
