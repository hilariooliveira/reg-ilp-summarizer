In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games.
The NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season because of the labor dispute.
The decision came after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player July 1.
Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer of hope.
