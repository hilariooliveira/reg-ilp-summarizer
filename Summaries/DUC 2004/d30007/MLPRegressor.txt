Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.
Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport facing a rebel assault.
The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes.
He said the government had been using the Boeing 727 to fly in troops and ammunition in Kindu for several days.
Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Kabila.
