Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.
After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.
He said the rebels likely fled back to their bases after the attack.
The site _ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern Illinois.
The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes.
