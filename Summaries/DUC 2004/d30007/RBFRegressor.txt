After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.
The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400 tribes.
After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila.
