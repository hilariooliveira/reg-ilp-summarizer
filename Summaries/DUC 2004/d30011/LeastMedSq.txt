Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.
The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday.
Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office.
The two had differed over economic policy as the country veered into recession and Anwar has said the 72-year-old Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader.
He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
