The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday.
Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office.
Local newspapers that are normally pro-Mahathir have splashed close-up photos of Anwar's badly bruised face for two days.
The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year rule.
Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial.
