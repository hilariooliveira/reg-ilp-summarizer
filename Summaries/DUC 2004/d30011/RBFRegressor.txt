Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday.
Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.
Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia.
Another letter then appeared, saying Aness would not go through with the appeal.
He told the magistrate's courts he was beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest.
