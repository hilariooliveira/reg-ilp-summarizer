Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia.
Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader.
Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office.
Anwar is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial.
