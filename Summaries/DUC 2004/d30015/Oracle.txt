The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province.
But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago.
He plans to meet with the Kosovan Albanian leaders on Tuesday.
Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a meeting with Milosevic.
Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert and moved some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo.
