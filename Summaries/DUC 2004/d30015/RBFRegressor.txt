The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province.
A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.
Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Following a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian province was as bad now as two weeks ago.
