Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday.
About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years, including 60 so far this year.
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages, having harvested only 3 million tons of grain this year, about two-thirds of the minimum needed by its 23 million people.
By comparison, a similar survey of North Korean children under 7 found that 65 percent are stunted and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition.
