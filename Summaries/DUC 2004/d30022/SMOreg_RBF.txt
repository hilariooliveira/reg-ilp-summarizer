In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese officials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an opposition political party.
A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting the overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations.
Wang was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations.
