House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections.
The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes.
Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker.
Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's losses on Tuesday.
