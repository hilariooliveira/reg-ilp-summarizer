America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said Sunday.
The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc.
Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught up to Netscape's.
Its decision to keep Netscape as a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership with Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said.
