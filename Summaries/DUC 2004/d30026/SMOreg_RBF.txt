America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said Sunday.
The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc.
AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business.
After all, about 22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America Online.
Microsoft is also investing heavily in new media and electronic commerce.
