Primakov reassured the businessmen, members of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment in Russia, that the government had no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars in Russia.
But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around.
Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
Or as Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money, Russia will have to impose ``unpopular measures.''
