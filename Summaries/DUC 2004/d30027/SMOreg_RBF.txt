Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing state property.
Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday.
In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms by decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around.
National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko was in Washington this week for consultations with IMF officials.
