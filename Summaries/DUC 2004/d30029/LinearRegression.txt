Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts missing.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra.
Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on Sunday night.
The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned.
