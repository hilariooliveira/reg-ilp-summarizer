Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra.
British sailor Glyn Charles was swept off the Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas.
The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen.
