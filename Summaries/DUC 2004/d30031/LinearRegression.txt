Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.
The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said.
NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
