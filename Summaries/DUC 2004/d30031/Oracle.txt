A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station.
Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks.
The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm.
The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up their hands.
In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight.
The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.
