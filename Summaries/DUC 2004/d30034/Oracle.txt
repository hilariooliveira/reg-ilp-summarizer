Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory.
In a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders Saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975.
The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement, which cited resistance sources in East Timor's capital, Dili.
