Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement claimed.
The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year.
