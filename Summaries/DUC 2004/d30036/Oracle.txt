Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence.
The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year.
Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago.
All the announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is given in Oslo, Norway.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes.
