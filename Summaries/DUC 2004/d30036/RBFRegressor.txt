Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.
The prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most prestigious prize for writers.
Since the 1980s, his works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
