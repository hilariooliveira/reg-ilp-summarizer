Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement.
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said he has since been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping Salt Lake City of the games over alleged rules violations during the bid.
