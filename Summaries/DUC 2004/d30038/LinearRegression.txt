Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet.
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member Marc Hodler.
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's allegations.
The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the bid committee at the time.
