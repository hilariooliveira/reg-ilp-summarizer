TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects.
Libya has accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, to try to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed 270 people.
