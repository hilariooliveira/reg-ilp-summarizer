Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.
Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing.
A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue.
But this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon.
