Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.
Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.
If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue.
Oil companies of all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration.
A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News.
