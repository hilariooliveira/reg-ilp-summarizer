Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.
If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue.
Although the companies only confirmed that they were discussing the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions said the boards of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to consider an agreement.
This summer, British Petroleum announced a $48.2 billion agreement to buy Amoco Corp., creating the world's third-largest oil company and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation.
