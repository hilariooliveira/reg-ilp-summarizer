A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international space colonization.
Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
It will serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications.
The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, of which the United States is expected to pay dlrs 24 billion.
