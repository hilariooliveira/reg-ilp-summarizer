President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to repair the largest economy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's gubernatorial elections.
Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy battered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week.
The plan is part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion.
The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial crisis buffeting developing nations for more than a year.
