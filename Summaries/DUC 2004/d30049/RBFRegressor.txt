The United States rejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government delegation.
Rubin said the U.S. delegation to North Korea had pressed for access to the site.
The Clinton administration fears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
The North Koreans have denied the underground construction site has any nuclear purpose, and it has demanded a dlrs 300 million payment for proving that.
