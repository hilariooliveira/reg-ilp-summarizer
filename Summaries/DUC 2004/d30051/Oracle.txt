American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment.
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.
Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal.
The trial also will give survivors of his killing spree chance to tell their story in court.
Delic was cleared of two murders, and of command responsibility for other killings at Celebici.
