Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.
Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank.
Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of ignoring commitments in peace accords.
Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
Clinton said the United States shares Israel's concerns about security.
