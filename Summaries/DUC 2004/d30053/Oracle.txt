Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.
Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
The Palestinians have insisted that they have already revoked clauses in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction.
The United States has said it should go ahead as scheduled.
