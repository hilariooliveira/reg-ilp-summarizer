The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.
In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament to approve NATO strikes.
Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence by a single vote.
Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leaders to devise a strategy.
Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II.
