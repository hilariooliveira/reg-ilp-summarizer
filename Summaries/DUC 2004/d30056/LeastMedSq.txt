Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them.
A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported.
The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined up Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies.
