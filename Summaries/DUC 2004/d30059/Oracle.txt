A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.
A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city, officials said.
Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was walking up the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young aide Friday evening.
Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide scaled the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg.
It was not clear whether the shooting was related to Starovoitova's death.
