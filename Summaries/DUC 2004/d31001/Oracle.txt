A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said Monday.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday.
He said it would take de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to avoid delaying its release Thursday.
The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid's horrors.
The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to the healing process.
But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators did not come forward.
