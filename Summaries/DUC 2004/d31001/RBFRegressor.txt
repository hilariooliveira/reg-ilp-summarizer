Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts.
The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more than two years of nationwide hearings.
They include two unnamed generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African National Congress, he said.
The commission found her accountable for human rights violations committed by her bodyguards, who the report said killed and tortured suspected opponents.
