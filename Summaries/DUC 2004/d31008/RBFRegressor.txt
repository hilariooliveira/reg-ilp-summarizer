Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence was a scarecrow.
Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several years of high school and college here.
He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.
