Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence was a scarecrow.
But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier.
Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
