A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form a new government.
The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support for Yalim Erez.
Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday.
The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state bank.
Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a no-confidence motion.
