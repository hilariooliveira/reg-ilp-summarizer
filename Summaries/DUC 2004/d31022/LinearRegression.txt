A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
