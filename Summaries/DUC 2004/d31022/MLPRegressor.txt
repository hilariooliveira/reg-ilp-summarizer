A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.
The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and six others died later.
