A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and six others died later.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
