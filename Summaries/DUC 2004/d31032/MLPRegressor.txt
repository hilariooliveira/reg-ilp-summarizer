Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.
There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.
But Yeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution took effect.
``Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state authority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee.
