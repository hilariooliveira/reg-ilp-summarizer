Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.
Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996.
Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term.
However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
Yeltsin was suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's doctors told the Interfax news agency.
