The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today.
Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows.
The government says that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition.
The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case since May.
