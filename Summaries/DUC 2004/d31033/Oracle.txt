The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today.
In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties.
The government says that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition.
The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department.
At the time, it was a tiny company and eager to do a deal with Microsoft.
