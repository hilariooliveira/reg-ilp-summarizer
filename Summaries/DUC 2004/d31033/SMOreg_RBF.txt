Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week.
The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today.
In its suit, the government asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department.
